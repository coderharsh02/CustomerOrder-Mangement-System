Used lambda functions practically anywhere possible, along with 
STL functions, containers, iterators, and algorithm libraries. 
The for_each, find_if, and transform are the most frequently used 
algorithm library functions.

I gained a good understanding of library functions because to 
this project. It answered all of my questions about iterators.

OOP345 brought in a lot of novel ideas. I had trouble keeping 
up with everyone at first, but the course notes are amazing!
I always keep notes open while creating workshops or milestones.
When we need to examine the operation of a specific function, 
it is helpful.

It was fun for me to make this project. It's true that the directions 
are not very clear, which is why it took me so long. The hardest part 
of the LineManager function Object() { [native code] } was getting it 
to work. But in the actual world, where we would not get as many 
instructions for any project, all of this effort would pay off.
We appreciate you offering a project and course materials of this caliber.
